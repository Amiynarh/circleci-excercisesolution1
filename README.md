3. An account in the CircleCI.

## Instructions
###### Step 1. Set up a CircleCI project
* Go to https://app.circleci.com/ and set up a new project associated with your Github repository
* If you repo does not contain a ./circleci/config.yml file, it will prompt you to create one. Choose a "hello-world" starter config file. The CircleCI      will attempt the first build process. Don't worry if it fails at this moment.
